### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m currently pursuing a degree in **Information Systems at UNASP**, where I’m developing a solid foundation in software development, infrastructure, and technology strategy.  
I’m passionate about creating solutions that are both functional and intuitive, and I’m especially drawn to areas like **DevOps**, **cloud computing**, and **automation**.  
I enjoy working on meaningful projects, learning new technologies, and contributing to collaborative, purpose-driven teams. My goal is to continuously evolve as a developer while staying curious, creative, and open to innovation.

### 💡 Fun Fact

I believe that creativity and logic aren’t opposites — they’re teammates. Whether building a script or designing a solution, I find joy in the balance between **code and imagination**.
